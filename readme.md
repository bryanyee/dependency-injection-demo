# Dependency Injection Demonstration
A demo of dependency injection techniques in JavaScript

## Using this demo
First, install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

To run the test cases:
```bash
npm test
```

If you would like to run the example client application, first run the webpack tranpilation process:
```bash
npm run build
```

Then open `example_client/index.html` in your web brower of choice.
